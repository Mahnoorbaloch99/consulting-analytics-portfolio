# 💳 EMI Product Financial Model – Fintech Market Entry Analysis

## Project Context
This project was developed as part of an **early-stage financial and commercial analysis** for *USI Money*, a fintech exploring market entry with an EMI-based digital payments product similar to **Monzo** and **Revolut**.

The objective was to assess the **commercial feasibility, cost structure, and scalability** of launching an EMI product in a competitive fintech landscape, focusing on both **business customers and individual users**.

This model represents a **semi-detailed initial version**, designed to support strategic discussions rather than serve as a final investor-ready forecast.

## Business Objective
USI Money aimed to:
- Enter the digital payments and EMI market
- Compete with established neobanks and fintech players
- Capture early market share through differentiated pricing and product structure

The key strategic question was:
> *Is an EMI-based fintech product commercially viable given expected customer growth, pricing, and cost structure?*

---

## Scope of Analysis
The financial model focuses on:
- Initial setup and onboarding costs
- Fixed and variable operating costs
- Revenue streams from businesses and individuals
- Customer growth assumptions
- Unit economics and early profitability dynamics

---

## Key Assumptions
- Target market includes **both businesses and individual users**
- Business customers are charged through **subscription-based pricing plans**
- Individual users incur fees primarily for **physical card issuance**
- Customer base grows gradually in Year 1, with scalability considered in later periods
- Costs include technology, operations, compliance, and customer acquisition

> Detailed assumptions are documented separately to allow flexibility and scenario testing.
