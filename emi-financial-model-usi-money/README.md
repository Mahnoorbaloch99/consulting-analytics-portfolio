# 💳 EMI Product Financial Model – Fintech Market Entry

## Project Context
This project was developed as part of an early-stage financial and commercial analysis for **USI Money**, a fintech exploring market entry with an EMI-based digital payments product similar to Monzo and Revolut.

The model was designed to support strategic discussions around feasibility, pricing, and scalability rather than serve as a final investor-ready forecast.

---

## Business Objective
USI Money aimed to:
- Enter the digital payments and EMI market
- Compete with established neobanks and fintech players
- Capture early market share through differentiated pricing and product structure

**Key question:**  
Is an EMI-based fintech product commercially viable given expected customer growth, pricing, and cost structure?

## Scope of Analysis
The financial model focuses on:
- Initial setup and onboarding costs
- Fixed and variable operating costs
- Revenue assumptions across customer segments
- Unit economics and contribution margins
- Early-stage profitability and scalability considerations

## Files Included
- `Financial Model v1.xlsx` – Core financial model
