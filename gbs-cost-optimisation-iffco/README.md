# 📊 Global Business Services (GBS) Cost Optimisation & Rightsizing – IFFCO

## Project Context
This project was conducted as part of a **Global Business Services (GBS) transformation and cost optimisation initiative** at **IFFCO**, a large FMCG and manufacturing organisation operating across multiple regions.

The initiative aimed to **rightsize shared service functions**, improve operational efficiency, and deliver sustainable cost savings through data-driven decision-making and financial analysis.

## Business Problem
IFFCO faced increasing cost pressure due to:
- Overlapping roles across corporate and shared service functions  
- Inefficient cost allocation across Centres of Excellence (COEs)  
- Limited financial visibility into fixed vs. variable cost drivers  

Senior leadership required a **structured financial view** to:
- Identify optimisation opportunities  
- Quantify potential cost savings  
- Support informed rightsizing decisions  

---

## My Role & Responsibilities
I worked on the **financial analysis and modelling stream** of the GBS programme, with responsibilities including:

- Building **cost and COE-level financial models** to assess current-state spend  
- Analysing **headcount, cost structures, and functional overlaps**  
- Supporting **scenario analysis** to evaluate different rightsizing options  
- Quantifying **short-term and recurring cost savings**  
- Preparing **management-ready summaries** to support leadership decision-making  

My role focused on **financial feasibility and impact assessment**, not operational HR execution.

## Key Outcomes & Impact
- Supported a rightsizing exercise impacting **~560 roles** across shared services  
- Identified **substantial recurring cost savings** at an enterprise level  
- Improved transparency around **GBS cost drivers and efficiency gaps**  
- Enabled leadership to make **data-backed restructuring decisions**  

All figures are referenced at a **high level** to maintain confidentiality.
