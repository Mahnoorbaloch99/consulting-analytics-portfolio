📊 Wildlife Strike Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
Project Context
This project was completed as part of an MSc Business Analytics coursework focused on designing a functional, user-centred Power BI dashboard.
The objective was to translate a complex aviation dataset into clear, decision-oriented insights using effective data visualisation principles and interactivity.
The emphasis of this project was not only technical accuracy, but also dashboard design, audience relevance, and analytical storytelling, in line with real-world consulting and analytics practices.
Business Problem
Wildlife strikes present significant operational, safety, and financial risks to the aviation industry.
Airports and aviation authorities require visibility into when, where, and how these incidents occur in order to prioritise preventive measures and operational controls.
This dashboard addresses the following business questions:
Are wildlife strikes increasing over time?
During which times of day do strikes most frequently occur?
Which phases of flight are most exposed to strike risk?
Are there geographic or regional strike hotspots?
Dataset
The analysis uses an aviation wildlife strike dataset containing reported incidents across multiple years.
Key variables include:
Incident year
Time of day
Phase of flight
Aircraft type
Geographic location
Species involved
Basic data preparation, cleaning, and field formatting were performed directly within Power BI.
Key Insights Visualised
1️⃣ Wildlife Strikes Trend Over Time
This visual highlights long-term patterns in wildlife strike frequency, helping identify periods of increasing operational risk and potential underlying trends.
2️⃣ Incidents by Time of Day
This chart shows when wildlife strikes most commonly occur, supporting time-based risk mitigation and operational planning.
3️⃣ Phase of Flight vs Strike Frequency
This visual identifies the operational phases most exposed to wildlife strike risk, particularly during critical flight moments such as approach and landing.
4️⃣ Geographic Distribution of Wildlife Strikes
A map-based visualisation highlighting the spatial concentration of wildlife strikes, enabling identification of geographic hotspots and high-risk regions.
Dashboard Interactivity
The Power BI dashboard includes interactive slicers that allow users to:
Filter incidents by aircraft type
Explore strike patterns by species
Focus on specific operational dimensions
These interactions are designed to support exploratory analysis without overwhelming the user.
Tools & Techniques
Power BI (Dashboard design and interactivity)
Time-series analysis
Categorical comparison
Geospatial visualisation
User-driven slicers and filters
Target Audience
